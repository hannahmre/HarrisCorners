# HarrisCorners

This program implemented Harris Corners algorithm as well as two ranking corners techniques. Harris Corners is used to detect corners within in image. For method 1, the percentage varies depending on the image. For method 2, the block size and the # of pixels selected varies depending on the image.

Observations: 
Method 1 works better on images with less detail and clear corners. 
Method 2 works better on images with lots of detail and not so clear corners.

Notes: 
The images labeled "img#.jpg" are the resulting images after using Harris Corners. 
The images labeled with names (i.e. new-york.jpg) are the orginial images before using Harris Corners. 
There is a .pdf file included which is my report of the assignment. 
There is only 1 .py file needed to run the code.
